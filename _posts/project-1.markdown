description: This project unraveled the patterns of New York City's building permits to aid in real estate investment decision-making. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the analysis focused on predicting future home prices and identifying structures built before 1940 that may be ripe for renovation. By forecasting the approval trends of building permits, using time series analysis techniques like ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM, this project revealed valuable insights about real estate growth across the city's boroughs. It specifically showcased the LSTM model's superior forecasting ability with an average RMSE across all boroughs of 26.08.
